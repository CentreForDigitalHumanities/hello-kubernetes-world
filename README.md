## How I got this frontend site up and running

I combined knowledge from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31163633/how-to-host-a-reveal-js-presentation/ and https://revealjs.com/installation/#basic-setup .  
Using the basic setup I could view the `index.html` locally before git pushing just by opening it in the browser.
Add steps
- HTML knowledge
- IMG dependency but also not replication note and references
- PDF extraction is possible (test vertical slides)
