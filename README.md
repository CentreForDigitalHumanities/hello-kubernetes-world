## How I got this frontend site up and running

I combined knowledge from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31163633/how-to-host-a-reveal-js-presentation/ and https://revealjs.com/installation/#basic-setup
Using the basic setup I could view the index.html locally before commiting just by opening it in the browser.
